# Glove-For-Deaf
Gloves For Deaf was created to translate hand signs into language that could be seen on an LCD. Each finger of the gloves is equipped with a flex sensor that provides a value that is converted using an ADC. The values of the sensors are then tracked to determine which message or sentence should be displayed on the LCD.

# System Design 
we will implement a device that can transcript the sign word on LCD:
❑ Five flexible sensors must be put on all fingers respectively.  
❑ Flexible sensors fast response detect any motion of fingers.   
❑ According to the posture of fingers, the relative meaning will 
be printing on the LCD.   
❑ The number of words must be transcript must not be less than 
fifteen words.    
❑ Old word will be cleared if a new word is activated.   

# Specifications –Flexible sensors 
1. They are used to detect any motion of fingers, every finger must 
has an individually one.
2. According to the position of pack of fingers, the relative word will 
be printed on LCD.
