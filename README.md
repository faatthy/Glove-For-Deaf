# Glove-For-Deaf
Gloves For Deaf was created to translate hand signs into language that could be seen on an LCD. Each finger of the gloves is equipped with a flex sensor that provides a value that is converted using an ADC. The values of the sensors are then tracked to determine which message or sentence should be displayed on the LCD.
